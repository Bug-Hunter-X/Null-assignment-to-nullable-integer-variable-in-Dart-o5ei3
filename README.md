# Null Assignment to Nullable Integer Variable in Dart

This example demonstrates a common error in Dart related to assigning null to a nullable integer variable.  While Dart's null safety features are robust, there are still situations that can lead to unexpected behavior or compile-time errors if not handled carefully.

The `bug.dart` file contains the problematic code that shows the errors when assigning null to a nullable integer. The `bugSolution.dart` file presents a corrected version to address the problem.

## How to Reproduce
1. Copy the code in `bug.dart` into a Dart file.
2. Run the file using a Dart compiler.
3. Observe the compilation errors when null is assigned to the `_myVariable`.

## Solution
The solution involves handling the potential null value appropriately, for example by using the null-aware operator (`??`) to provide a default value when the variable is null, or by using the null check operator (`!`) after ensuring the variable is not null.
